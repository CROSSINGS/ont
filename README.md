This is the development repository of a network of ontologies whose goal is to model the underpinning of martial arts in general, with a view on the potential entities that may serve as carriers of cultural influence.

This effort is supported by CROSSINGS (Computational Interoperability For Intangible and Tangible Cultural Heritage). For more information visit [CROSSINGS@EM+](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/emplus/projects/crossings/)
